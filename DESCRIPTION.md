# Classification Project 

This project utilizes three different classification algorithms—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—to predict whether a patient is depressed based on their medical and psychological data.

**Dataset**
**The dataset used in this project was obtained from the Big Data Processing course.**
The dataset contains various features such as Name, Gender, Height, Education Level, Eye Color, Married, Salary Income, and Depressed, that describe the medical and psychological attributes of patients. These features will be used to train and evaluate different classification models.

# Steps in the Classification Process

**1. Load Data**
We load the dataset and examine its structure to ensure all relevant features are available.

**2. Select Features**
We select features that are critical for predicting depression. This part is important as it will determine the final outcome and its accuracy.

**3. Data Preprocessing**
We remove missing or irrelevant data to prepare the dataset for training.

**4. Transform Data**
We convert categorical features into numerical format using when statements to enable model training.

**5. Normalization**
We normalize the features to ensure they are on a similar scale. This improves the performance of the model.

**6. Generate Model**
We use three different classification algorithm which is Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. After testing the model, we can compare these algorithm to find which one is the best. 

**7. Model Testing and Evaluation**
We evaluate the model using the test dataset and calculate accuracy.

# Analysis
**1. Logistic Regression**
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used to model the probability of one or more independent variables. In this context, we are trying to predict whether someone is depressed (yes/no) based on features such as education, marital status, and income.

Advantages:
- Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement. Suitable for beginners.
- Interpretability: The model’s results are easy to interpret, allowing us to see the impact of each feature on the probability of depression.
- Performance: Good for datasets with a linear relationship between features and the target. If the dataset is linear, Logistic Regression can yield good results.

Analysis:
Logistic Regression may be more effective when the data has a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables. If the primary goal is to gain a clear interpretation of how features influence depression, this method is a good choice.

**2. Decision Tree**
Decision Tree is a machine learning method that uses a tree structure to make decisions. Each node in the tree represents a feature, and branches represent decisions made based on the value of that feature.

Advantages:
- Visualization: Easy to visualize and understand. Very useful for presenting analysis results.
- Non-Parametric: Does not require assumptions about the distribution of the data, making it more flexible regarding the type of data.
- Handles Non-linear Relationships: Capable of handling non-linear relationships between features and the target.
  
Analysis:
Decision Trees are very effective for understanding how decisions are made based on features. However, one drawback is their tendency to overfit if not pruned properly. This can be an issue if the dataset is small or very noisy.

**3. Random Forest**
Random Forest is an ensemble method that uses many decision trees to improve model accuracy. Each tree provides a prediction, and the final result is taken based on voting or averaging.

Advantages:
- Robustness: More resistant to overfitting compared to a single decision tree because it leverages the diversity of multiple trees.
- Accuracy: Tends to provide better accuracy than other methods in many situations, especially with complex data.
- Feature Importance: Capable of providing information on which features are most important for predictions.

Analysis:
Random Forest is often a good choice for complex and unstructured data, where many variables interact. However, this model can be more difficult to interpret compared to Logistic Regression.


**Conclusion**
Why Choose Certain Methods:
- Logistic Regression: Best when the dataset is linear and interpretability is very important. For example, if you want to clearly understand the impact of education on depression.
- Decision Tree: Good for easy understanding and visualization, but care must be taken to avoid overfitting.
- Random Forest: The best choice if you want high accuracy and have complex data. However, its interpretation can be more challenging.
